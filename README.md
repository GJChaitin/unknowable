In this branch Here we have:

* LISP interpreters in
  - [C](https://github.com/GJChaitin/unknowable/blob/master/lisp.c),
  - [Mathematica](https://github.com/GJChaitin/unknowable/blob/master/lisp.m), and
  - [Java](https://github.com/GJChaitin/unknowable/blob/master/lisp.java),
* example LISP programs and output from "The Limits of Mathematics" (ISBN-13 978-1852336684), and
* example LISP programs from output from "The Unknowable" (ISBN-13: 978-9814021722)
* [Chapter 2](https://github.com/GJChaitin/unknowable/blob/master/ch2.md) rendered in Markdown so it appears nicely on Github.

All of the the above, books and software, are written by Gregory J. Chaitin.

This branch strives to contain code as it was originally written circa 1999-2000. Much of it might now work in modern environments.
For modern code, see the "master" branch.

The above material all comes Archive.org:

* [The UNKNOWABLE](https://web.archive.org/web/20060924160850/http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unknowable/)
* [The UKNOWABLE Chapter 2 alternate location](https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/unknowable) and for portions of "The Limits of Mathematics" (2003).

Links to the code can be found off of the latter site.

File extensions ending in `.l` are LISP programs; extensions ending in `.r` is output from running the program through the LISP interpreter.
